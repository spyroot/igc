N+1 indicates all members are active, are unaware, and their functions do not dependent on each other. However, at least one extra member is present to achieve functionality. In this state, 'Sparing' is implied, and each member can be a spare for the other(s). An example of N+1 is a system that has 2 power supplies, but needs only 1 power supply to functioning properly. N+1 is a special case of N+M redundancy where M=1. A value of N+1 is used for N+M redundancy. Sparing indicates that all members are active and are aware of other members. However, their functionality is independent until failover. Each member can be a spare for the other(s). 'InputPowerRedundancy' indicates that the power supply redundancy policy is set to 'Input Power Redundancy'.",
